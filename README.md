# Student Management System - MVC PHP

This project is a simple implementation of a Student Management System using the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture in PHP.


- The `app/` directory contains the application's core components:
  - `controllers/` holds the controller classes responsible for handling user requests.
  - `models/` contains the model classes responsible for database interactions.
  - `views/` includes the view files responsible for rendering data.

- The `public/` directory is the entry point of the application:
  - `index.php` initializes the application and routes requests to the appropriate controllers.

- The `config/` directory contains configuration files:
  - `database.php` stores database connection information.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo.git
   ```

2. Set up your web server (e.g., Apache) to point to the `public/` directory as the document root.

3. Create a database named `mvc` and execute the SQL script to create the `students` table.

4. Configure the database connection by updating the `config/database.php` file with your database credentials.

5. Access the application by navigating to your server's URL (e.g., `http://localhost`).

## Features

- View a list of students.
- Add new students to the database.
